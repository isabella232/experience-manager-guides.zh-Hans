## Running Test:

Using FMPS, you may automatically publish **PDF, Responsive HTML5**, and **Epub** for your DITA and FM Assets.

From the "Generate PDF using" menu, choose FrameMaker Publishing Server.

The user can provide "Settings File(.sts)" and "ditaval. Filtering will be done using Ditaval based on the conditions you supply.

-   **Setting file**: FrameMaker /FMPS Publish setting which contains all those settings which you want FMPS to honour while publishing For example: ,Generating output with customised template ,Generating Marks and Bleeds(PDF) , Generating PDF with TOC , index etc .
-   **FMPS present:** Pre-defined combination of Ditaval and Settings file , Instead of giving separate Ditaval and settings file , User can pre-create FMPS preset which can be re-used for publishing need.

**Note:**  If you don't select any of Settings or FMPS Preset then FMPS will publish with default system setting.

If you have selected FMPS Preset and also provided Settings/Ditaval file from AEM then this will conflict and FMPS Preset will be given precedence over custom Settings/Ditaval file.
